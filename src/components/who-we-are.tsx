                        If youâ€™re going to go with a minimalist style in just
                        one area of the home, then choose your home office. A
                        clean and clearly organised workspace is conductive to
                        great concentration and an uninterrupted workflow.

                        Less visual clutter leads to less mental clutter, and
                        you will be able to find your needed files and equipment
                        a whole lot faster too.
