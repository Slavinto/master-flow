Now, when looking at the eCommerce landscape, we see a relatively mature market with established players and a clear set of rules. But this impression can be misleading – the digital transformation is not over yet and is unlikely to ever come to a halt, driven by the flow of innovation coming from numerous start-ups and a growing cashflow from fast-developing Asian economies. In spite of a slowing Chinese economy, a shift in purchasing power from the U.S. and Europe to China and Southeast Asia has begun, fueled by the growing number of consumers gaining access to eCommerce due to growing purchasing power and internet penetration, especially on mobile devices.",

Revenues are expected to grow at a CAGR(1) of 12.2% up to 2027, resulting in revenues of US$2,088.2 billion. In other words, the Chinese market is expected to show the largest growth rates of the three major regions. In the U.S. market, revenues of US$925.4 billion were generated in 2023. Judging from the CAGR of 11.2%, the market is expected to exceed revenues of China reaching $1415.8 billion by 2027. The third biggest eCommerce market in 2022 is Europe with revenues of 631.9 billion. Annual growth of 9.3% will lead to revenues of US$902.3 billion by 2027.",

            "As we become ever more dependent on devices and their connections to the internet, it’s no surprise that cybercriminals are finding more inventive ways of taking advantage of this dependence. However, it’s almost impossible to gauge the exact impact of cybercrime in the U.S. since most of these attacks are likely to go unreported or falsely reported.However, according to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercrime has had a major impact on the global economy, with an estimated worldwide cost hitting $8 trillion in 2023 — translating to over $250,000 a second. The total annual cost of cybercrime is predicted to rise to $10.5 trillion by 2025. However, not all figures spell doom and gloom. People are generally becoming more aware of cybersecurity and adopting better ‘cyber hygiene,’ or common practices against cybercrime. As an example, the number of people using VPNs rose by 16% between 2020 and 2022. While VPNs don’t necessarily protect you, they help keep your information private and secure. Nevertheless, online criminals are constantly looking for ways to extort online individuals and businesses. We’ve looked at some statistics across cybercrime and cybersecurity to paint a broader picture.",

It was estimated that the total cost of cybercrime across the world would reach $8 trillion in 2023 — and is predicted to hit $10.5 trillion in 2025. While there were fewer individual victims of cybercrime in 2023 (just over 350 million) compared to 2022 (over 425 million), there were over 1,400 more compromises in total. The average amount of money lost by businesses as a result of cybercrime in 2023 was $1.3 million. Across all industries, the average cost of a data breach was $4.45 million, with the healthcare industry facing the highest average data breach cost at $10.93 million.",

In the United States alone, an FBI report predicted the potential loss resulting from cyberattacks and fraud to hit over $10.2 billion in 2022. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center received over 800,000 reported complaints in 2022, and while this is 5% lower than in 2021, the actual amount lost in dollars increased by 49%. The most reported type of incident was phishing, followed by personal data breaches and non-payment/non-delivery, but investment fraud was the most costly, resulting in losses of $3.3 billion — up by 127% compared to 2021. How many cybercrimes are committed each day? It’s hard to know exactly how many cyber attacks happen per day as not all are reported. It’s estimated that one occurs every 39 seconds — but businesses were expected to be attacked every 11 seconds in 2021. The cost of damage caused by cyber-attacks globally is around $16.4 billion a day — or $190,000 a second, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. ",

There are around 4.1 million websites that are affected by malware around the world, according to Sectigo. The report also stated that 48% of small business owners think their websites are too small and they won’t be a target.

Additionally, just 28% of companies use AI extensively as part of their cybersecurity efforts. Figures also show how organizations of varying sizes are affected differently by cyber attacks — those with fewer than 500 employees saw a 13.4% increase in average losses resulting from data breaches. Companies with 500 to 1,000 employees saw an increase in average losses of 21.4%, while those with 1,001 to 5,000 employees also saw a rise of close to 20%. However, perhaps as an indication of investment in cybersecurity correlating with the size of a business, companies with more than 10,000 employees actually saw the average cost of data breaches fall slightly. Regardless of business size, 57% of organizations increased the prices of their products and/or services as a result of the data breach, showing that consumers often absorb the cost of cyber attacks. Following incidents concerned with ransomware, 37% of businesses affected did not end up getting law enforcement involved.
